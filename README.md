# SEED-Security-Labs-Solutions

This repository contains my solutions and work for a selection of the hands-on SEED Labs, which are designed to teach fundamental concepts in computer and information security. The repository is organized into four folders, each corresponding to a specific lab.

## 1. Secret-Key Encryption

This lab focuses on the core concepts of **symmetric encryption**. The exercises provide hands-on experience with different encryption algorithms, modes of operation (like ECB and CBC), the necessity of padding, and the role of an Initial Vector (IV). The goal was to use and understand these primitives to encrypt and decrypt messages securely.

## 2. RSA Encryption and Signature

This lab explores **asymmetric cryptography** through the lens of the RSA algorithm. The tasks involved generating public and private key pairs, performing encryption and decryption, and creating and verifying digital signatures. This provides a practical application of the number theory that underpins the RSA cryptosystem.

## 3. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

Building on public-key concepts, this lab dives into the **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** that secures much of the internet. The objective was to understand how PKI prevents Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks by verifying the ownership of public keys. The exercises demonstrate the chain of trust, the role of Certificate Authorities (CAs), and the consequences of a compromised root trust.

## 4. SQL Injection Attack

This lab shifts focus to **web application security** by demonstrating one of the most common vulnerabilities: SQL Injection. The tasks involved identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in a sample web application to understand how an attacker can manipulate database queries. The lab also covers defensive techniques and best practices to prevent such attacks.
